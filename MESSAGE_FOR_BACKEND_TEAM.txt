Hi Backend Team,

The STEP file 404 errors are still occurring after the recent changes. The frontend is getting:

HTTP 404 - {"detail":"Not Found"}

for these files:
- model_PR001.step
- assembly_PR001.step

Frontend is requesting:
- https://hexa-outlook-backend.onrender.com/api/files/model_PR001.step
- https://hexa-outlook-backend.onrender.com/api/files/assembly_PR001.step

Quick questions:

1. Are the backend changes deployed to Render? (committed ≠ deployed)
2. Can you test the health endpoint: https://hexa-outlook-backend.onrender.com/api/files/health
   - Does it show model_PR001.step and assembly_PR001.step in the available_files list?
3. Are the files actually on the Render server filesystem? (not just in git)
4. What do the backend logs show when these URLs are requested?

The frontend now has a health check that will show what files the backend reports as available vs what we're requesting, which should help diagnose the issue.

Thanks!
